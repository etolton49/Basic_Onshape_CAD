## Part 1

I just finished making the base plate for part 1. It was fairly simple and took barely a minute. I did struggle with the feature pattern for a minute though. I clicked the wrong edge and couldn't figure out why it was only patterning 4 hole instead of 6. In the end I have just clicked the wrong edge for the direction of the pattern and it was a simple fix.
