## Part 1
<img src="Part_1.png" width="80%">
I just finished making the base plate for part 1. It was fairly simple and took barely a minute. I did struggle with the feature pattern for a minute though. I clicked the wrong edge and couldn't figure out why it was only patterning 4 hole instead of 6. In the end I have just clicked the wrong edge for the direction of the pattern and it was a simple fix.

## Part 2
<img src="Mount.png" width="80%">
I made my second part, the mount, in the same parts studio as my base. This made it very easy as all I had to do was draw the sqaure and all the holes I had made on the base were continued into the mount. The only issue with this is that if I wanted to change the holes just on one I could run into an issue; however, these holes are intended for screws so it really shouldn't matter because they should always be on top of each other.

## Part 3
<img src="Fork.png" width="80%">
I chose to make this part in a separate studio because it did not reference any of the previous parts. It was failry straight forward and I didn't really struggle with it. The tangent fillets definitely were helpful and nice because you only have to select one edge.

## Part 4
<img src="Tire.png" width="80%">
This is my tire for the caster. It was my first time using revolve in Onshape and it went smoothly. I'm starting to get used to using some of the shortcuts which are definitely nice.

## Part 5
<img src="Wheel.png" width="80%">
Here is my wheel. Everything went smoothly on this part. I didn't think it would be beneficial to keep it in the same part studio as the tire so I made a separate one. 

## Part 6 and 7
<img src="Axle_Collar.png" width="80%">
This is my axle and collar made in one part studio. Pretty simple.

## Part 8
<img src="Bearing.png" width="80%">
This bearing was very simple. Just two cicles referencing the center of the wheel.

## Part 9
<img src="Big_Bearing.png" width="80%">
This piece was also very easy. I decided to made it in the same studio as my fork as I know that it is refencing that part.

## Wheel Subassembly
<img src="Wheel_Subassembly.png" width="80%">
Here is my first attempt at an assembly in Onshape. It went well the only thing I struggled with was selecting the right mate connector.

## Final Assembly
<img src="Final_Assembly.png" width="80%">
This is the final caster assembly. All the pieces went well together. I found it easier to preclick all the whole or edges where I wanted my screws before I selected insert, this way I could do them all at once. I think that using the mate connectors will take some getting used to but they're really not any harder than SolidWorks mates. Also, there is something so satisfying about having all my parts in one document and being able to easily add them to my assembly. Here is the link to my document with all the parts in it: https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/df6af577b8ad48bdc50f1b40/w/fd1c3f458be3824a12b97b2f/e/ca27e43cf5f98fe91a7b5e50.

## Configurations
<img src="Picture_Frame.png" width="80%">
This is my picture frame using dowel pins and configurations. It went pretty smoothly but sometimes the connector mates didn't work out quite right. I found that if the sections of the frame were oriented the correct way then the mates didn't work and Onshape couldn't solve them. This was pretty easy to fix either using parallel mates of just reorienting the part and trying the mate again.

## Challenge
<img src="Challenge.png" width="80%">
Here is my week 5 milestone challenge. It went pretty smoothly other than the mating. I struggle with the mates for some time before ending up using the cylindrical mates. I was about ready to rebuild the whole thign because I couldn't get the revolute mates to work. Also, next time I will circular pattern around a mate connect instead of creating an axis.
